Don't forget to make `session-key.js` from the example.

# Keyboard Shorcuts

* `up/down/left/right` - move straight
* `w/a/s/d` - dig
* `i/o/k/l` - move diagonally
* `z/x` - up/down staircase

## Still to implement

- [x] show inventory
- [x] drop
- [x] use
- [x] dig
- [ ] repair inventory items
- [ ] when a monster is killed, issue a notification and remove it from the map
- [ ] when an item is picked, issue a notification and remove it from the map
- [ ] level up
- [ ] highscores
- [ ] planeshift

## Bugs

- [ ] the map is reversed... so what?!?
